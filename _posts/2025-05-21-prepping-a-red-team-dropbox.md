# Prepping a Red Team Dropbox - A Practical Guide to Stealthy Hardware Implants - 1

## Introduction
In today's advanced red team operations, **hardware implants** â€” often referred to as "dropboxes" â€” play a critical role in achieving initial access or establishing long-term persistence inside a target environment.

A dropbox, in this context, is a **small, stealthy device** planted inside a network to provide remote access, monitor activities, or pivot further into systems. Whether itâ€™s hidden behind a printer, inside a conference room cabinet, or connected under an unused desk port, **a well-prepared dropbox can be the quiet backdoor** a red team needs to simulate real-world adversary behaviors.

In this blog post, Iâ€™ll walk you through the essentials of prepping a dropbox for a red team engagement â€” from hardware selection to operational considerations.
## Choosing the Right Hardware

First things first: **portability and stealth** are non-negotiable. Depending on the operation, the device should be small, quiet (no fans if possible), and power-efficient. For this red team dropbox, I selected a **compact, powerful, and network-resilient setup** based on the following components:

[**Raspberry Pi 4 / 5**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/)
The **Raspberry Pi 5** is the heart of the implant:

- **Powerfull processor and high specs**: More than enough for running VPN tunnels, C2 agents, packet captures, and even light pivoting tasks.
- **Small form factor**: Lightweight, flexible and easy to hide inside furniture, ceilings, or server rooms.
- **USB 3.0 and PCIe** support: Useful for fast LTE module integration and external storage if needed.
- **Official case options** help it blend into office equipment, making it less suspicious.

[**Sixfab 3G â€“ 4G/LTE Base HAT for Raspberry Pi**](https://sixfab.com/product/raspberry-pi-base-hat-3g-4g-lte-minipcie-cards/)
To enable **out-of-band (OOB)** communications without relying on the target's network:

- The **Sixfab LTE HAT** acts as a bridge between the Raspberry Pi and a cellular network.
- Provides **UART and USB interfaces** to communicate with the LTE module.
- Designed specifically for the Pi series, ensuring compatibility and low power consumption.

[**Quectel EC25 LTE Modem**](https://www.quectel.com/product/lte-ec25-series/)
The **Quectel EC25** is the modem module used for LTE connectivity:

- **4G LTE support** across many global bands (depends on the EC25 variant you pick â€” EC25-E, EC25-A, etc.).
- **Built-in GNSS (GPS)** support â€” not typically needed for dropboxes but can be useful in some tracking ops.
- Robust **AT command set** to control connection settings, monitor signal strength, and manage fallback logic.
- Relatively stealthy â€” can work without aggressive LED indicators or external routers.

[**LTE Antennas**](https://www.m2mmarket.com.tr/4g/lte-screw-mount-ipex-ufl-conmector-25-dbi-10cm-2778)
Finally, **high-gain LTE antennas** were attached to ensure stable and reliable cellular connections:

- Placed strategically inside or outside the casing depending on deployment needs.
- Directional antennas were preferred in some scenarios for better signal targeting.

I mounted the Sixfab HAT directly onto the Raspberry Pi GPIO header, attached the EC25 module onto the HAT, and connected two LTE antennas externally through pigtail cables for better reception.  
This compact build fits easily into small enclosures and can be powered via PoE (with a PoE HAT) or standard USB-C adapters.
## Building the Software Stack

Once hardware is selected and piece together, the next phase is **software preparation**.
#### **Deploy an OS on the Raspberry Pi for Dropbox Use**
To prepare the Raspberry Pi 5 as a red team dropbox, the first major step is **flashing and configuring the operating system (OS)**.  
Hereâ€™s a simple, reliable way to do it:
Choose OS
For red team dropboxes, you typically want an OS that is:
- Lightweight
- Headless (no GUI needed)
- Easy to harden
Recommended options:
- **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** (Debian-based, official)
- **Ubuntu Server for Raspberry Pi** (better for server operations)
- **Kali Linux ARM version** (if you need preinstalled offensive tools)

For most dropbox operations, **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** is ideal because itâ€™s minimal and blends into networks easily but in our case we will use ubuntu server for better server operations.
I will not explain how to flash an operating system on a Raspberry Pi. You can easily find information on this with a quick search on the internet.

#### **Installing and Setting Up QMI on Raspberry Pi for LTE Connection**
**QMI (Qualcomm MSM Interface)** is a protocol used to control cellular modems like the **Quectel EC25**. Instead of handling LTE as a traditional serial device (PPP), using **QMI** allows:
- **Faster LTE connections**
- **Higher bandwidth**
- **Better stability**
Itâ€™s much more efficient â€” perfect for a red team dropbox that needs reliable communication.

Update your system:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
Install required packages:
```bash
sudo apt install libqmi-utils udhcpc
```
Connect and detect the modem:
```bash
lsusb
```
```yaml
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 2c7c:0125 Quectel Wireless Solutions Co., Ltd. EC25 LTE modem
```
Download the QMI installer file and change permission for install
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sixfab/Sixfab_QMI_Installer/main/qmi_install.sh
sudo chmod +x qmi_install.sh
sudo ./qmi_install.sh
```
At the end of installation enter any key to reboot your Raspberry Pi. Attach the USB cable of the HAT.
Navigate to the Quectel files that were installed in the previous step.
```bash
cd /opt/qmi_files/quectel-CM
```
Now run the following command to connect to the Internet.
```bash
sudo ./quectel-CM -s [YOUR APN]
```

> ðŸ“˜ NOTE
>
> ./quectel-CM [-s [apn [user password auth]]] [-p pincode] [-f logfilename] -s [apn [user password auth]]

Finally, request an IP address using udhcpc:
```bash
sudo udhcpc -i wwan0
```
Auto connect on reboot
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sixfab/Sixfab_QMI_Installer/main/install_auto_connect.sh
sudo chmod +x install_auto_connect.sh
sudo ./install_auto_connect.sh
sudo systemctl status qmi_reconnect.service
```

## Communication Planning and Scripting

**Core capabilities to install:**

- **Reverse SSH tunnel setup** (autossh, systemd services)
    
- **VPN client** (WireGuard or OpenVPN for secure connections)
    
- **C2 beaconing agent** (Covenant, Mythic, custom scripts)
    
- **Packet capture tools** (tcpdump, tshark) for passive monitoring
    
- **Credential harvesting tools** if needed (responder, ntlmrelayx)
    

**Persistence mechanisms:**

- Setup auto-start scripts for reverse shells.
    
- Backup communication channels: VPN > SSH > ICMP tunneling (fallbacks are important!).
    

**Bonus:** Encrypt communications with SSL/TLS certificates, and consider integrating a hidden kill-switch to remotely brick the device if necessary.


## Operational Security (OpSec) Tips

- Always assume the device might be found: use **full-disk encryption** to protect stored data.
- Don't use your real IP addresses in communications.
- Build self-destruct mechanisms (e.g., if login attempts > 3, wipe storage).
- Avoid using easily fingerprinted software versions (e.g., stock Kali OS banners).
## Final Testing and Checklist Before Deployment

Before taking the device into the field, double-check:

- Remote connection stability under different conditions.
- Automatic recovery from unexpected power loss.
- Beacon and fallback mechanisms.
- Device physically secured and disguised properly.
- Logging turned off or logs automatically rotated and wiped.
# Conclusion

A well-prepared dropbox can mean the difference between a successful red team operation and a failed one. By focusing on **stealth, reliability, and OpSec**, you ensure that your hardware implant not only survives inside the target environment but actively helps achieve your red team's mission goals.

In the next post, Iâ€™ll dive deeper into **advanced dropbox tricks**, including **dynamic C2 switching** and **building covert channels using cloud services**.

Stay tuned â€” and stay stealthy. ðŸ‘»
